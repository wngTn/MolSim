# Run Instructions #

In this assignment we have used the compiler `g++ 11.1.0`.

# Warning # 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you have slow internet**: We fetch three packages with *FetchContent*,
> thus the initial CMake-build may take some time (~1min)

## Task - Googletest ##

We decided to include the googletest library with CMakes *FetchContent*. Thus,
it is required to have reasonably fast and stable internet to successfully build with CMake 
(*Deutsche Bahn*-wifi with 20 Mb/s download speed is still enough).

The CMake automatically enables building the tests. Therefore, to run the tests,
simply execute CMake as usual, head to your `build` folder, go to the `test` subfolder
and run `ctest`. 

### Running the tests ###

1. Create the build directory and cd into it:
```shell
mkdir build && cd build 
``` 
2. Build everything, including the tests in the build directory
```shell
cmake .. # building tests is default ON
``` 

3. Compile everything, including the tests:
```shell
make # use "make -j4" for faster compilation
``` 

5. Change directory to `test` and run `ctest`:
```shell
cd test && ctest
``` 

### Disabling the tests ###

If you do not want to compile the tests, you can turn off the build option
in the CMake (Step 2):

```shell
cmake .. -DBUILD_TEST=OFF # Makefile won't build the tests anymore
```

## Task - Logging ##


## Task - Lennard Jones Potential ##

The input format is [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). 
**You can declare several shapes in an array.** 
For every shape of those you have to specify the following:

| Property   | Possible Values  
|----------|:-------------:|
| type |  "cuboid", "sphere" |
| pos |  [\<double>, \<double>, \<double>]   | 
| vel |  [\<double>, \<double>, \<double>] |
| N | [\<int>, \<int>, \<int>] |
| distance | \<double> |
| mass | \<double> |
| brownian factor | \<double> |
| brownianDIM | \<int> |

> üöß **The type "sphere" is still work in progress, i.e. it does not do anything.**

Here is an example for an input file, which creates two "cuboid" shapes:
```json
{
  "shapes":
  [
    {
      "type": "cuboid",
      "pos": [0.0,0.0,0.0],
      "vel": [0.0,0.0,0.0],
      "N": [40,8,1],
      "distance": 1.1225,
      "mass": 1.0,
      "brownianFactor": 0.1,
      "brownianDIM": 3
    },
    {
      "type": "cuboid",
      "pos": [15.0,15.0, 0.0],
      "vel": [0.0,-10.0,0.0],
      "N": [8,8,1],
      "distance": 1.1225,
      "mass": 1.0,
      "brownianFactor": 0.1,
      "brownianDIM": 3
    }
  ]
}
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you do not comply to these specifications, it may lead to unexpected behavior**

### How to run the program ### 

In this assignment, our input format has changed a little, to give you - 
our sacred and precious user - even more functionality!

The general program call is now:

```shell
./MolSim [-i <input_file>] [-t <input type>] [-e <end_time>] [-d <delta_t>] [-w <writer>] [-c <calculator>] [-b <brownian_motion_velocity_mean>]
```

| Flag   | Possible Values | Explanation | Default |
|----------|:-------------:|-------------| ------- |
| `i` |  `path/to/file` | This is the relative or absolute path to your `input_file`. | *None*
| `t` |  g, generate, r, random, *\<omit>* | Indicates the input type: <tt> g/generate</tt> if you input a `JSON` file, and <tt>r/random</tt> if you want to generate a random input file, with the input format from assignment 1. If you omit this flag, the input file format of assignment 1 will be chosen. | *None*   
| `e` |  \<double> | The end_time value | 1000
| `d` | \<double> | The delta_t value | 0.14
| `w` | v, vtk, x, xyz | Specifies the output writer, consequently also the output file format | v (vtk)
| `c` | g, grav, gravitation, lj, lennardjones | Declares what forces between the particles should be calculated | lj (lennardjones) 
| `b` | \<double> | The <tt>brownian motion velocity mean</tt>. **Will be overwritten by the JSON file generated particles** | *None*
| `m` | normal, debug, benchmark | Specifies which execution mode should be used. **Debug** to enable logging, **normal** to disable logging or **benchmark** to disable all output files | normal

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Random generated files (t flag)** only support the input file format of assignment 1. Also, you will need Python 3 to use it.

Example:

```shell
./MolSim -i ../input_assignment_2.json -t g -e 5 -d 0.0002
```

This will use: 
- <tt>input_assignment_2.json</tt> as `input_file` 
- <tt>generate</tt> as `input_type` (uses JSON-file to setup the particles)
- <tt>5</tt> as `end_time`,
- <tt>0.0002</tt> as `delta_t`
- <tt>vtk</tt> as `writer` (default)
- <tt>lennardjones</tt> as `calculator` (default)
- <tt>0.1</tt> as `brownian motion velocity mean` (set in the input_file)
- - <tt>normal</tt> execution mode (default)

Another example:

```shell
./MolSim -i ../eingabe-sonne.txt -c grav -m debug
```
This will use:
- <tt>eingabe-sonne.txt</tt> as `input_file`
- *because file format of assignment 1 is used, the t flag is omitted*
- <tt>1000</tt> as `end_time` (default)
- <tt>0.14</tt> as `delta_t` default)
- <tt>vtk</tt> as `writer` (default)
- <tt>gravitation</tt> as `calculator`
- No `brownian motion velocity mean`
- <tt>debug</tt> execution mode



## Benchmarking ##



## Miscellaneous ##

In this assignment we managed to run the program on the new 
**MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro** processor. 

To run the program on macOS with an M1 (Pro) processor you have to follow the following
steps:

1. Install homebrew (taken from https://brew.sh/)
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install xerces-c:
```shell
brew install xerces-c
```

3. Install GCC 11.1.0:
```shell
brew install gcc
```

4. Create a build directory and cd into it:
```shell
mkdir build && cd build
```

5. Execute CMake and set gcc and g++ compiler you just installed:
```shell
cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<path to your gcc-11> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path to your g++-11>
```
If you have installed gcc via homebrew on an M1 (Pro), 
then the default path to your <tt>gcc-11</tt> is: `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/11.2.0_1/bin/gcc-11`.


The default path to your <tt>g++-11</tt> is: `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/11.2.0_1/bin/g++-11`.

6. And finally you can compile everything:

```shell
make -j
```

We use ANSI escape sequences for our console output. If you do not see any color and
see seemingly random sequences, switch to a Unix operating system :).
