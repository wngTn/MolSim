# Run Instructions #

In this project we have used the compiler `g++ 11.1.0`.

## Task - Googletest ##

We decided to include the googletest library with CMakes *FetchContent*. Thus,
it is required to have reasonably fast and stable internet to successfully build with CMake 
(*Deutsche Bahn*-wifi with 20 Mbps download speed are still enough).
